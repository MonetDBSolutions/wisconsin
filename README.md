# The Wisconsin benchmark

This repository is set up to demonstrate the creation 
of a database instance with the seminal Wisconsin workload
as described in [DeWitt 1993](http://jimgray.azurewebsites.net/benchmarkhandbook/chapter4.pdf_) .

The data generator is available as a Python program in ./src
The data dirctory contains the data and scripts to instantiate
the database.

The information gathered by sqalpel is stored in the
sqalpel.yaml file. It is used to initialize a project.
